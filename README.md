# colorBBDP

ColorBBDP is a Python program which uses the Beta-Bernoulli Dirichlet Process Mixture Model to perform a clustering of the World Color Survey data. The model implemented is using the BayesPy program (https://github.com/bayespy/bayespy) which implements variational Bayesian inference for conjugate-exponential family models. 

The bayespy_wcs.py is the module which contains the code for executing the model on the World Color Survey data set. Supplementary code and files are also included in this package.
